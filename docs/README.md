# Welcome to the Tiny AI API Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the **Tiny Ai API** system. This project is designed to help you manage and organize sessions efficiently, handling prompts, dialogues, file data, system instructions, and much more.

With this system, you can:
- **Create and manage data sessions**: Start and stop sessions, and select the active session.
- **Store and retrieve data**: Store prompts, dialogues, file data, and system instructions with easy retrieval.
- **Track session tokens and hashes**: Monitor tokens and hashes associated with specific data within each session.
- **Handle file uploads**: Attach files to sessions and retrieve them as needed.
- **Customize your workflow**: Select the active session, update data, and perform actions programmatically using event-driven methods.

This documentation is designed to provide all the information you need to get up and running with the system. Whether you're building an application or managing multiple data sessions, this guide will walk you through every feature, offering a detailed explanation of how each function works and how to use it effectively.
